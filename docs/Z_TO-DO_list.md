TO-DO
Implement dark mode toggle in Settings
Begin appRouter migration phase
Expand to Path, Flashcard, Tool branches (full feature flow)

🛠️ TODO: Modularize Transitions into transition_builders.dart
Create a lib/navigation/transition_builders.dart file to house reusable route transition styles.
Extract buildCustomTransition(...) from app_router.dart and refactor into multiple named builders:
buildSlideTransitionPage(...)
buildScaleTransitionPage(...)
buildFadeTransitionPage(...)
Update each route in app_router.dart to use the correct transition method.

✅ Benefits:
Centralized management of all animations.
Cleaner app_router.dart.
Easy reuse in future branches (flashcards, paths, tools, etc.).



📌 TODO: Expand /content route to support full ContentScreenNavigator behavior
Once sequencing and dynamic back navigation are required, update the /content route and context.push(...) calls to support:
✅ sequenceTitles: full list of content item titles
✅ contentMap: a map of titles → content blocks
✅ startIndex: index of the selected item in the sequence
✅ onBack logic: allow returning to a specific screen like /lessons/items with contextual extras (module, branchIndex, etc.)
This will allow ContentDetailScreen to act as a full ContentScreenNavigator, supporting:
🔁 Previous / Next navigation
🔙 Correct backDestination handling

// 🟠 TODO: Add `onBack` parameter to ensure correct back navigation
// This screen should call `CustomAppBarWidget(onBack: ...)` with appropriate context.go(...) logic




//To-Do: grey out the unused previous/next button rather than it disappearing
// To-Do: add a loading spinner while the content is being fetched
// To-Do: handle the case where there are no items in the chapter
// To-Do: consider adding a scroll to top button if the list is long
// To-Do: add error handling for when the chapter is not found

move tools to left of flashcards?

pathItem = flashcard, doesn't navigate to flashcardDetailScreen

Option to add darkTheme + themeMode: ThemeMode.system when ready.

Excellent prompt. Let's break this down with precision. We'll conduct a full audit of **`.go()` vs `.push()` usage** across your codebase (based on the latest uploaded file `Z_bcc5_all_others_20250405_195841.txt`), then offer:

1. **A complete file-by-file usage table**  
2. **Explanations for each case**: Why `.go()` or `.push()` was used, and if it needs to be changed  
3. **A task checklist**: Clear list of proposed refactor tasks (mergeable when appropriate)

## ✅ Audit: `.go()` vs `.push()` Usage

| **File** | **Method** | **Usage Context** | **Should Be** | **Notes** |
|---------|-------------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| `landing_screen.dart` | `.go()` | Navigating to `/learning-paths/...` | ✅ `.go()` | ✅ Correct: top-level branch/tab nav |
| `flashcard_category_screen.dart` | `.push()` | Navigating to `/flashcards/items` | ✅ `.push()` | ✅ Correct: keeps stack inside flashcards |
| `flashcard_item_screen.dart` | `.push()` | Navigating to `/flashcards/detail` | ⚠️ `.go()` preferred | ❗ Needs `.go()` + `transitionKey` to match detail screen behavior |
| `flashcard_item_screen.dart` | `.go()` | Returning to `/flashcards` via AppBar | ✅ `.go()` | ✅ Correct: replaces stack when backing to parent screen |
| `main_scaffold.dart` | `.go()` | BottomNavBar routing | ✅ `.go()` | ✅ Correct: resets stack per branch/tab |
| `navigation_buttons.dart` | `.go()` | Navigating to next/prev detail screens | ✅ `.go()` | ✅ Correct: detail-level, same-stack swap |
| `flashcard_detail_screen.dart` | `.go()` inside `onBack()` | Returns to `backDestination` | ✅ `.go()` | ✅ Correct, given MainScaffold wraps screen |
| `lesson_module_screen.dart`, `part_zone_screen.dart`, `tool_bag_screen.dart` | `.go()` (assumed) | Nav to `/items` screen | ⚠️ Missing `transitionKey` | 🛠 Needs `.go()` audit for `transitionKey` injection |

## 💬 Clarifying Guidelines

### When to Use `.go()`
Use when:
- You're switching top-level tabs (BNB)
- You're **replacing** the current screen entirely (not nesting deeper)
- You want to **reset** the navigation stack

### When to Use `.push()`
Use when:
- You're going **deeper** into a navigation hierarchy (like opening an item from a list)
- You want to **preserve** the current screen in the back stack
- You’re showing a modal or a drill-down detail (like flashcard detail from a list)

## 🔧 Recommended Tasks (Grouped)

### 📂 `flashcard_item_screen.dart`
- [ ] ✅ Convert `.push('/flashcards/detail')` → `.go('/flashcards/detail')`
- [ ] ✅ Add `transitionKey` to all `.go()` calls

### 📂 `lesson_module_screen.dart`, `part_zone_screen.dart`, `tool_bag_screen.dart`
- [ ] 🛠 Audit `.go()` usage for missing `transitionKey`
- [ ] 🧼 Add `transitionKey` when navigating to `/items` routes

### 📂 `main_scaffold.dart`
- [ ] ✅ Already uses `.go()` for tab navigation — **no changes needed**

### 📂 `landing_screen.dart`
- [ ] ✅ All `.go()` calls are appropriate — **no changes needed**

---

## 🧭 Final Task Checklist

| **File** | **Task(s)** |
|----------|-------------|
| `flashcard_item_screen.dart` | Convert `.push()` to `.go()` for detail, inject `transitionKey` |
| `lesson_module_screen.dart` | Ensure `.go()` to `/lessons/items` includes `transitionKey` |
| `part_zone_screen.dart` | Ensure `.go()` to `/parts/items` includes `transitionKey` |
| `tool_bag_screen.dart` | Ensure `.go()` to `/tools/items` includes `transitionKey` |
| `navigation_buttons.dart` | Already OK — `.go()` for forward/back item nav |
| `main_scaffold.dart` | Already OK — `.go()` for BNB |
| `landing_screen.dart` | Already OK — `.go()` for learning paths |

Ready to begin the refactors?  
If yes, I recommend we start with `flashcard_item_screen.dart` — it has the most immediate impact and is the only file currently misusing `.push()` where `.go()` is required. Shall I start there?

change landing page to have a new crew start here button and a knock the rust off picker to distinquish between the two users


change the toolBag to:
calculations
checklists
emergency procedues (always on top?)
references (colregs, lights, sounds)






some ideas:
Your `MainScaffold` is already solid and clean, but here are a few polishing suggestions to make it airtight and consistent with the rest of your app architecture:

---

### ✅ 1. **SlideDirection.left for BNB back transitions**
When switching *backward* (e.g., from index 3 → 2), you could optionally set the `slideFrom` based on the relative tab index to reflect directionality.

```dart
final SlideDirection direction =
    (index < branchIndex) ? SlideDirection.left : SlideDirection.right;
```

Then in `context.go(...)`:

```dart
context.go(
  destination,
  extra: {
    'transitionKey': UniqueKey(),
    'detailRoute': DetailRoute.branch,
    'slideFrom': direction,
    'transitionType': TransitionType.slide,
  },
);
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Use `ValueKey` for `transitionKey` if desired**
Currently you're using `UniqueKey()`, which is great for forcing a rebuild. But if you want transitions between tabs to look a bit smoother (not full rebuilds), using `ValueKey('tab_$index')` would help with stability.

---

### ✅ 3. **Optional: Support hiding BNB per branch**
If you ever need to hide the bottom navigation for a detail-only branch, you could wrap it in a flag:

```dart
final hideBNB = false; // or compute based on current route

bottomNavigationBar: hideBNB ? null : BottomNavigationBar(...)
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Optional: Add `onLongPress` for tooltips/debug**
For dev/testing or power users, long-pressing a BNB item could log debug info:

```dart
BottomNavigationBarItem(
  icon: GestureDetector(
    onLongPress: () => logger.d('Long pressed tab $index'),
    child: Icon(Icons.public_outlined),
  ),
  label: 'Modules',
),
```

9. partZoneScreen hover highlights the zone somehow?

10. add tons of info

11. create learning Paths persistence

13. 

remember flashcards strengths/weaknesses to suggest review deck

better "no path to resume" than those black snackbars...

toolBagScreen image line 27

maybe change MOB to screen not modal
log for MOB presses with gps, time/date data
