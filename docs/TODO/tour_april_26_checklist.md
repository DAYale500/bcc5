Awesome, I'm glad you're curious — because you're in a *perfect* place to either tighten things up now or log these for "small polish" tickets later.  
Here’s a ✨ **Next Tiny Improvements Checklist** tailored to exactly where you are:

### ✨ Tiny (Optional) App Tour UX Polish List

| Priority | Suggestion | Why it Might Be Worthwhile |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 🔥 (very quick) | **Show a short Snackbar after tour ends:** "Tour Complete! 🎉" | Gives users closure and feedback when the tour ends, especially if it auto-closes |
| 🔥 (very quick) | **Fade the yellow highlight border slightly (e.g., 90% opacity)** | Looks a little softer and more "polished" rather than full-neon; better for dark mode too |
| 🔥 (easy) | **Support a slight bounce animation on the yellow border** | Makes the focus area "pop" without needing a huge redesign — very lightweight and optional |
| 🔥 (medium) | **Add a gentle "fade in" when moving between tour steps** | Right now the box and bubble jump instantly — a 150–250ms fade would feel very premium |
| ✅ (already halfway there) | **Fix Settings "Dark Mode" switch so it actually toggles** | Right now it’s a fake switch (because dark mode wiring is commented out); easy to fix |
| 🎯 (next big win) | **Extend Tour to New Screens (Tools, Lessons, Parts, etc.)** | Now that LandingScreen is working, wiring up 3-4 other screens will feel very logical and modular — reuse your current approach |

### ✏️ If you want a super short action plan:
- **Phase 1:**  
  - [ ] Add "Tour Complete!" Snackbar after `widget.onEnd()`.
  - [ ] Fade yellow border to `Colors.yellowAccent.withOpacity(0.9)`.

- **Phase 2:**  
  - [ ] Optional: Tiny bounce animation on the highlight.
  - [ ] Optional: Fade between tour steps.

- **Phase 3:**  
  - [ ] Expand tour coverage across app (ToolsScreen, LessonsScreen, etc.).

### ⚡ Why bother with these now?
Because you're already fully in the mental model of how the Tour works (Highlight → Controls → TourController → OverlayManager → LandingScreen) —  
**These would take 10x longer if you come back cold later.**

Would you like me to pick **one** quick patch first (like the "Tour Complete!" snackbar)? 🚀  
(That’s the fastest and highest bang-for-buck in Phase 1.)
