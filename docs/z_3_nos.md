✅ Rule: Follow the Three No's
No Omissions

No “…” truncations

No “placeholder” logic

No skipped parameters, imports, or behaviors

Every block must be explicit, complete, and runnable

No Inventions

I will never introduce new logic, components, or styles
unless we have discussed and agreed on it first

All suggestions will be grounded in your actual implementation and files

No Assumptions

I will ask before guessing

If anything is ambiguous, I will clarify with you first

No reliance on generic Flutter patterns or shortcuts unless confirmed
