# 🧠 Flashcard Crash Investigation & Resolution Summary

### 📅 Date: 2025-03-31  
### 🧑‍💻 Context: Mixed-content navigation via `ContentScreenNavigator`  
### 💥 Problem: App crashed when rendering a flashcard, despite the flashcard existing inline in the lesson repo.

---

## ❗ Problem Summary

### Symptom
- Crash with:  
  `type 'Null' is not a subtype of type 'List<ContentBlock>'`
- Triggered from `ContentScreenNavigator → buildRenderItems → getContentObject` when tapping a valid flashcard ID.

### Sequence of Events
1. User tapped on `lesson_syst_2.00`
2. Navigation passed valid `sequenceIds` including:
   - `lesson_syst_2.00`
   - `flashcard_lesson_syst_2.00`
3. In `initState()`, `buildRenderItems()` looped over all `sequenceIds`
4. `getContentObject()` tried to resolve `flashcard_lesson_syst_2.00`
5. `LessonRepositoryIndex.getFlashcardById()` returned `null`
6. `sideA + ContentBlock.divider() + sideB` → 💥 crash

---

## 🕵️ Root Cause

### 🚨 1. Eager resolution of all sequenceIds
- Even though user tapped index 6, all 24 `sequenceIds` were resolved immediately.
- This forced lookup of flashcards that hadn’t yet been rendered.

### 🚨 2. `getFlashcardById()` didn’t find the flashcard
- Flashcard *was* inline in the `Lesson` model (not separate file).
- But `getFlashcardById()` looped only shallowly or used stale logic.
- Result: returned `null`, even though the flashcard *existed*

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### ✅ 1. Patched `LessonRepositoryIndex.getFlashcardById()`
```dart
static Flashcard? getFlashcardById(String id) {
  logger.i('🔍 LessonRepositoryIndex.getFlashcardById → attempting lookup for "$id"');
  for (final lesson in _modules.values.expand((list) => list)) {
    for (final card in lesson.flashcards) {
      logger.i('   • checking ${card.id}');
      if (card.id == id) {
        logger.i('✅ match found in lesson module for $id');
        return card;
      }
    }
  }
  logger.e('❌ Flashcard not found in lesson modules for id: $id');
  return null;
}
```

- 🔁 Similar logic was added to:
  - `PartRepositoryIndex.getFlashcardById()`
  - `ToolRepositoryIndex.getFlashcardById()`

---

### ✅ 2. Updated `getContentObject()` in `render_item_helpers.dart`
```dart
if (id.startsWith('flashcard_')) {
  final flashcard = LessonRepositoryIndex.getFlashcardById(id) ??
                    PartRepositoryIndex.getFlashcardById(id) ??
                    ToolRepositoryIndex.getFlashcardById(id);

  if (flashcard != null) {
    return RenderItem(
      type: RenderItemType.flashcard,
      id: flashcard.id,
      title: flashcard.title,
      content: flashcard.sideA + ContentBlock.divider() + flashcard.sideB,
      flashcards: [flashcard],
    );
  } else {
    logger.w('⚠️ No flashcard found for id: $id');
  }
}
```

- 🧠 This fallback chain ensures all flashcard types (lesson, part, tool) are checked.

---

## 🧯 Rejected Solution

### ❌ “Add null checks to sideA / sideB”
- This would hide the crash but not solve it
- Problem wasn’t null `sideA`, it was that `flashcard` was never found
- Fixing the getter logic was the **correct** fix

---

## 🧪 Result

- ✅ Crashes resolved
- ✅ Flashcards render from lessons, parts, and tools
- ✅ All `RenderItem` types now resolve correctly
- ✅ Path navigation stable again

---

## 🔍 Optional Future Work

| Idea | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Defer resolution of `RenderItem`s until needed | Would prevent wasted processing and bypass bad lookups |
| Track only the active ID and resolve on-demand | Matches navigation behavior more closely |
| Add diagnostics when a flashcard lookup fails | Makes debugging future issues easier |
