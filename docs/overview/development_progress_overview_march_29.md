## âœ… Phase 7: Navigation & Routing System

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| GoRouter architecture with transition helpers | âœ… Done | Handles forward/back logic, slide/scale effects. |
| PopScope-based back navigation | âœ… Done | Replaces deprecated `WillPopScope`, supports animated back. |
| ContentScreenNavigator logic | âœ… Done | Ensures sequencing, backDestination, backExtra, branchIndex. |

---

## âœ… Phase 8: BCC4 Migration

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Audit of BCC4 files | âœ… Done | All relevant files categorized as A (import), B (optional), C (skip). |
