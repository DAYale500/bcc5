agreed.

re: ðŸ§  Design Philosophy Comparison
great question. to date, I've thought about this and while open to continuing to discuss/think, I've been ok with conceptualizing it this way:

User point of view:
they will be interacting with the app in several ways that all have to work seamlessly together. They need to be scaffolded up via a learning path and free to explore any topic that occurs during the learning path or afterwards so the app becomes a tool for review, exploration, pre-evolutino refresh, with images for communicating.

Dev Team point of view:
this mainly involves ease of updating the data to add/modify/subtract without having to maintain consistency across many files. For example, if they realize that a learningPath is missing something between step 5 and step 6, they could insert (into a repository?) step 5.5 whatever item was missing (lesson, part, flashcard) and no where else (maybe associated image(s) added to the /assets/images), and then if the model and repository is set up correctly, that would be all: the new presentation to the user has that step seamlessly inserted. Similar reasoning for the lessons, parts, flashcards, keyword search: all would be updated from that single repository entry. However, lessons and parts are quite different, so we'd need both lesson repositories and parts repositories, which isn't difficult for a developer updating to choose the best one. Flashcards would be identical structure in both lessons and parts, and the flashcards branch would get that data from whichever repository is relevant at the time of the user requesting/being shown the flashcard. 

I think from an educator point of view, the learningPath needs to scaffold the three types of knowledge (lessons, parts, tools), with reinforcing quiz/flashcards inserted frequently (kept track of so the user can remember where they were less certain and see their progress). I think there needs to be a "Group" (chapter/module/zone/category) level for the tools branch named "Toolbags", 

roughly organized like so (change names likely)
    Procedures - Checklists, Troubleshooting, Emergency Playbooks
    References - Radio, Flags, Charts, Tables, Terminology
    Calculators - Formulas, Conversions, Anchoring Ratios, Distances
    Visual Aids - Symbols, Signals, Clouds, Navigation Markers
    Cognitive Aids - Rules of Thumb, Heuristics, Scenario Walkthroughs
    Ditch Bag - miscellaneous

Structurally: Are there three types of repositories (lesson/9, part/5, tool/6) and each item in each repository has its own content (able to interleave text, images, text, etc.) and its own flashcard(s), and its own keywords (to link in the search), and then various learningPaths (competentCrew for beginniers, review for rusty skippers, specific ones like anchoring, coming into a harbor, etc.)? 

And i realize that maybe having an easy-to-find "emergency" button always visible (Red triangle with an "!"?) that acts as a quick link to the emergency procedures for someone to follow.

and, is there some way a user can modify things for their personal preference (like adding/deleting/hiding steps in a checklist)?
