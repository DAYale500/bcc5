This is an incredibly thoughtful foundation — you're planning not just an app, but a **learning ecosystem**. Your approach balances:

- 🎓 **Pedagogical structure** (scaffolded learning paths),
- 🧭 **Exploration tools** (search, categories, flashcards),
- 🛠️ **Developer ergonomics** (modular, self-contained data),
- 🚨 **Safety UX** (emergency button), and
- ✍️ **User agency** (editable checklists).

## ✅ Summary of Proposed Structure

### 📦 Content Repositories
| Type    | Count | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Lessons | 9     | Grouped by sailing topics |
| Parts   | 5     | Grouped by zones of the boat |
| Tools   | 6     | Grouped into “Toolbags” (user-editable checklists, references, etc.) |

---

### 📄 Content Item Model (Shared by Lessons, Parts, Tools)

Each item should support:

```dart
class ContentItem {
  final String id;
  final String title;
  final List<ContentBlock> content;
  final List<String> keywords;
  final List<String> flashcardIds;
  final bool isPaid;
}
```

- `Lesson` and `Part` models can extend this or wrap it.
- `ToolItem` can inherit too, with additional `isUserEditable` flags if needed.

### 🧠 LearningPathItem

Each learning path will be a sequence of mixed items:

```dart
enum ContentType { lesson, part, flashcard }

class LearningPathItem {
  final ContentType type;
  final String itemId;  // id from the appropriate repo
}
```

So a learning path like "Competent Crew" might look like:

```dart
[
  LearningPathItem(type: ContentType.lesson, itemId: 'L1'),
  LearningPathItem(type: ContentType.part, itemId: 'P3'),
  LearningPathItem(type: ContentType.flashcard, itemId: 'F5'),
  ...
]
```

---

## 🚨 Emergency Access

An always-visible floating action button could link to:

```dart
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/emergency');
```

And show filtered content from a “Procedures” toolbag (like “Man Overboard”, “Fire”, “Abandon Ship”).

---

## ✅ Personalization: Editable Checklists

Checklists can be structured like:

```dart
class Checklist {
  final String id;
  final String title;
  final List<ChecklistStep> steps;
  final bool isUserCustom;
}

class ChecklistStep {
  final String text;
  final bool isChecked;
  final bool isHidden;
}
```

Store user-modified checklists in local storage (`shared_preferences`, local database, etc.) and sync with the original data structure on load.

## 🔜 Ready to Implement?

Would you like to:

1. ✅ Create this **shared content model structure** (for lessons/parts/tools)?
2. 🧱 Build 9 real lesson repositories using this?
3. 🧭 Wire up `LessonModuleScreen` ➝ `LessonItemScreen` ➝ `ContentDetailScreen` using the new data?

We can also prep the `LearningPathRepository` format next so you're fully scaffolded. Let me know what you'd like first!
