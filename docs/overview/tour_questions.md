Absolutely — I love this approach. Consider me your expert tour consultant. What we’re going to do is **treat the onboarding tour like a UX product within your app** — because it is. The goal is not just to show off features, but to:
- Reduce user friction
- Increase confidence
- Guide users through the first moments that shape whether they stick or bounce

### 📋 Phase 1: Discovery & Intent — Questions to Define Your Tour Strategy

#### 1. 🎯 What’s the core goal of the onboarding tour?
Choose as many as apply (or clarify in your own words):
- [x ] Highlight where key actions are located
- [ x] Teach user how to complete their first task (e.g., “Set sail on a new course”)
- [ x] Explain novel UI elements (e.g., MOB button)
- [ ] Promote underused features (e.g., search, emergency tools)
- [x ] Encourage deeper engagement (e.g., complete a lesson)
- [ x] Something else? <<highlight "Knock the Rust Off" learning paths for advanced users since these are perishable skills>>


---

#### 2. 🧭 Where should the tour begin?
- [ x] Automatically on first app launch?<<can be re-enabled in settings>>
- [ x] Triggered by user (e.g., “Start Tour” button in settings)?<<yes>>
- [ x] Automatically *after* first real action (e.g., entering a path)?<<is there a way to have the tour arrive piecemeal? If so, then yes, maybe a tour part 2 could be triggered upon opening a feature for the first time...>>
- [x ] All of the above (support multiple entry points)?

---

#### 3. 🧑‍🏫 Should it be one tour or multiple?
Some apps separate “Getting Started” vs “Advanced Tips”. Consider:
- [ ] A single tour with 6–8 steps
- [x ] One mini tour per section (e.g., Landing, Lessons, Tools, etc.)
- [x ] A progressive tour (only reveals next step after user does something)
- [ x] “Remind Me Later” or “Replay Tour” support?

---

#### 4. 📍 What elements are *must-show* in the tour?
Mark anything that is **tour-worthy**:
- [ x] MOB (Man Overboard) emergency button
- [ ] AppBar title (e.g., Competent Crew)
- [ x] Settings icon
- [ ] Search icon
- [ x] “Set Sail on a New Course” button
- [ x] “Resume Your Voyage” button
- [ ] Chapter and item navigation (e.g., Group buttons, content tiles)
- [ ] Flashcard flip or lesson transitions
- [ ] Other?
<<we can always add more later, right?>>
---

#### 5. 🧠 Do we want smart behavior like:
- [ ] Skipping steps if user already used that feature?
- [ x] Resuming tour if app is backgrounded?
- [ x] Making tour context-sensitive (e.g., different depending on branch)?

---

#### 6. 🧪 For this **proof of concept**, which screen should we test on?
- [ x] LandingScreen (good for global tour)
- [ ] LessonModuleScreen (simple, clean)
- [ ] LessonDetailScreen (more advanced)
- [ ] Something else?

---

#### 7. 🧩 Which library do you want to use for tour steps?
I assume we’re using [ShowCaseView](https://pub.dev/packages/showcaseview), unless you prefer:
- [ ] TutorialCoachMark
- [ ] FlutterOverboard
- [ ] Custom-built stepper overlay
- [ ] Not sure — help me choose
<<I thought we'd decided on `tutorial_coach_mark` - should we revisit this?>>

Once I get your answers, I’ll synthesize them into a **tour implementation plan** — starting with a small POC (proof-of-concept) flow and scaling toward a full onboarding experience.

Ready when you are.
