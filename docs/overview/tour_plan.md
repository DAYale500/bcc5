I would like to build a Tour. The idea is that a (new) user is unfamiliar with the way the app operates, so the tour would show them how to make the most out of the app. 

That's a great idea — an interactive **Tour** is one of the most effective ways to onboard new users and help them understand both the structure and the hidden gems of your app. Here are a few thoughts to help you design and implement this:

---

### 🚀 GOALS OF THE TOUR

1. **Orientation**: Help users understand what the app is *for* and how it's organized.
2. **Navigation**: Teach them how to move between paths, parts, tools, flashcards, etc.
3. **Actionable Tips**: Show them where to tap and why (e.g., how to resume a voyage, flip a flashcard, update settings).
4. **Trust and Confidence**: Let them feel they won’t get lost — they can explore and always return to safe harbor.

---

### 🧭 TOUR DESIGN STRATEGY

#### 1. **Trigger Options**
- ✅ First-time only (using SharedPreferences to store completion flag)
- 📘 Optional restart from Settings (“Restart App Tour”)
- 📍 Optional prompt from LandingScreen (“Take a quick tour?”)

#### 2. **Tour Styles**
Choose one or more:
- 🫣 **Overlay Coach Marks** (e.g., package like `tutorial_coach_mark` or `showcaseview`)
  - Dim screen except around the thing you're highlighting
  - Good for buttons, tabs, or icons

- 🧭 **Step-based Guide Modal**
  - Full-screen overlay that walks user through concepts with "Next" buttons
  - Example: “This is the Learning Paths screen. Tap a chapter to get started.”

- 🗺️ **Narrated Walkthrough**
  - Actually *navigates* to screens (e.g., tap into a path, show how flashcards work)
  - Pros: more immersive
  - Cons: requires smart backtracking logic and possibly mock content in dev mode

---

### 🪄 EXAMPLE TOUR STEPS (suggested flow)

| Step | Screen | Highlight / Focus |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| 1 | LandingScreen | Explain bottom nav (Harbor, Courses, etc.) |
| 2 | Tap "Set Sail" → PathChapterScreen | “Tap a chapter to explore” |
| 3 | PathItemScreen | “Each chapter has bite-sized lessons, tools, and drills.” |
| 4 | Tap a lesson → LessonDetailScreen | Highlight nav buttons, group picker |
| 5 | Flashcard flip feature | “Tap to flip. Swipe to learn fast.” |
| 6 | MOB button | “Tap this if someone falls overboard!” (serious moment) |
| 7 | Settings modal | Show how to update vessel info, enable reminders |
| ✅ | End | “That’s it! Ready to explore. You can restart the tour any time from Settings.” |

---

### ⚙️ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (in BCC5 style)

#### 1. **Track Tour Completion**
```dart
class TourManager {
  static const _hasCompletedTour = 'hasCompletedTour';

  static Future<bool> hasCompletedTour() async {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    return prefs.getBool(_hasCompletedTour) ?? false;
  }

  static Future<void> markTourComplete() async {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    await prefs.setBool(_hasCompletedTour, true);
  }

  static Future<void> resetTour() async {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    await prefs.remove(_hasCompletedTour);
  }
}
```

#### 2. **Choose a Tour Library or Build Custom**
Popular packages:
- [`tutorial_coach_mark`](https://pub.dev/packages/tutorial_coach_mark)
- [`showcaseview`](https://pub.dev/packages/showcaseview)
- Or, build a lightweight `TourOverlay` widget

#### 3. **Start Tour Logic**
```dart
void checkAndStartTour(BuildContext context) async {
  if (!(await TourManager.hasCompletedTour())) {
    Future.microtask(() {
      Navigator.of(context).push(MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (_) => AppTourScreen(),
      ));
    });
  }
}
```

---

### ✅ OPTIONAL BONUS FEATURES
- 🎯 Resume where user left off if they quit mid-tour
- 💬 Voice narration or captions (for accessibility)
- 🧪 A/B test: users who take the tour vs those who don’t (retention metric?)

---

Would you like to:
1. Start by building a simple `AppTourScreen`?
2. Implement coach marks (step-by-step highlight overlays)?
3. Navigate the user through a guided path (scripted journey)?

Let me know how you’d like to begin and I can scaffold it with your existing architecture in mind.











update april 11 1300

Awesome — let’s start with a scaffolded implementation of `tutorial_coach_mark` in BCC5. Here’s what we’ll do step-by-step. This will only affect the UI when explicitly triggered (e.g., by a “Show Me Around” button), so we can develop it safely:

---

### ✅ Step 1: Add the dependency

In your `pubspec.yaml`, add:

```yaml
dependencies:
  tutorial_coach_mark: ^1.2.4
```

Then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Choose targets

Let’s use **LandingScreen** for the first sample. We’ll highlight:

1. The bottom nav bar (Harbor icon)
2. The Courses branch
3. The “Set Sail on a New Course” button
4. The “Resume Your Voyage” button (if visible)

---

### ✅ Step 3: Scaffold the logic in `landing_screen.dart`

I’ll generate this for you in the next message. Want me to show you just the `LandingScreen` update first, or do both `LandingScreen` and `PathItemScreen` together?

re: 1
done

re: ✅ Step 2: Choose targets
Let’s use LandingScreen for the first sample. We’ll highlight:
The bottom nav bar (Harbor icon)
    what each means/does
Competent Crew button
MOB
Settings


<<below are not on landdingScreen, add them later>>
The Courses branch
The “Set Sail on a New Course” button
The “Resume Your Voyage” button (if visible)

Absolutely — your revisions and questions are right on target. Let me incorporate all your notes, provide clarifications where needed, and revise the plan accordingly.

## 🧭 BCC5 User Tour – Revised Implementation Plan

---

### 🔹 Purpose

The **Tour** introduces new users to the core interface and navigation of the app, so they can:
- Understand what each major section does
- Discover important features like:
  - **Competent Crew** (recommended starting point)
  - **Search** (explore content by keyword)
  - **Settings** (customize vessel & emergency data)
  - **Advanced Learning Paths** (like “Knock the Rust Off”)
  - **MOB Button** (access safety info quickly)
- Learn how structured content works in the app (Learning Paths → Chapters → Items → Detail Screens)  
  **🛈 Note:** Structural learning will be deferred to later phases when multi-screen tours are introduced.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 – Initial Tour: `LandingScreen` (MVP)

This is a **first-run experience only** (with optional retrigger later), limited to the Landing screen.

### 🧱 Screens Covered
- ✅ `LandingScreen` only

### 🎯 Tour Targets (in order of appearance)
We’ll highlight:

1. **AppBar title** – meaning of “BCC5” or “Welcome Aboard”
2. **Search icon** – explore topics like “fenders” or “radio”
3. **Harbor (bottom nav)** – used to return here anytime
4. **Competent Crew button** – start your foundational path
5. **Advanced Paths (e.g. Knock the Rust Off)** – for experienced sailors
6. **MOB button** – emergency info and procedures
7. **Settings icon** – enter boat/vessel data for emergencies

✅ All of these are currently visible on `LandingScreen`.

---

### 🧰 Tech Stack
Using [`tutorial_coach_mark`](https://pub.dev/packages/tutorial_coach_mark):

- Highlights any widget via `GlobalKey`
- Shows step-by-step overlay messages
- Supports “Skip,” “Next,” and touch-to-continue
- Fully customizable visuals
- Free, open source (MIT)

---

## 🏗️ Implementation Tasks (Phase 1)

| Step | Task |
|------|------|
| 1 | ✅ Add `tutorial_coach_mark` to `pubspec.yaml` |
| 2 | Add `GlobalKey`s for all targets listed above in `LandingScreen` |
| 3 | Wire `harborIconKey` **from `LandingScreen` → `appRouter.dart` → `MainScaffold`**, since it's only available there |
| 4 | Add a `startTour()` method to `LandingScreen` and call it with `addPostFrameCallback()` |
| 5 | Build the step list: assign `targetFocus`, `content`, `shape`, and `position` for each |
| 6 | Gate the tour with `SharedPreferences` so it only shows on first launch |
| 7 | (Optional) Add a “Show tour again” toggle in settings or dev mode for re-triggering tour manually |
| 8 | QA for onboarding clarity, overlaps, animation timing, and responsiveness across devices |

---

## 🔜 Phase 2 – Multi-Screen Tour (Future Expansion)

### 🧱 Screens
- `PathChapterScreen` (introduce chapters + “Set Sail / Resume”)
- `PathItemScreen` (clarify structure: lessons, parts, tools, drills)
- Any `*DetailScreen` (lesson, part, tool, flashcard)

### 🎯 Additional Future Targets
- “Set Sail on a New Course” button
- “Resume Your Voyage” button (if visible)
- Path items (e.g. “L1: Dock Lines”)
- “Next” / “Previous” / “Next Chapter” buttons
- Group picker dropdowns (e.g., switch zones)

This phase will require:
- Per-screen coordination
- Route-aware logic for re-entry
- Possibly splitting into “Tour 1: Basics” vs “Tour 2: Navigation Structure”

---

## 🗃️ Design Notes & UX Decisions

- ✅ **SharedPreferences** will track `"tourShown"` (bool) so we avoid repeat tours
- 🛠 **Manual retrigger?**  
  Let’s discuss: Options include:
  - Settings screen toggle: “Restart Tour”
  - Dev-only shortcut (e.g., long-press logo)
  - Snackbar after tour: “Show again?”
- ✅ **Only show once by default**
- ✅ Tour should never block core functionality
- 🎨 Make sure text is legible on both light and dark themes
- 🔄 Tour content should be updatable in future without resetting the flag

---

## ✅ Next Step

> You’ve already rolled back the unstable key passing, so you’re ready to **rebuild the tour cleanly**.

Would you like to:

- 🔨 Start with **Step 2** and I’ll walk you through wiring the `GlobalKey`s and `startTour()` logic for `LandingScreen`, or
- 💬 Discuss the “Restart Tour” UI/UX now?

Let's change the order:
We’ll highlight:
AppBar title – meaning of “BCC5” or “Welcome Aboard”
MOB button – emergency info and procedures
Settings icon – enter boat/vessel data for emergencies
Search icon – explore topics like “fenders” or “radio”
Harbor (bottom nav) – used to return here anytime
Competent Crew button – start your foundational path
Advanced Paths (e.g. Knock the Rust Off) – for experienced sailors



update April 12 1936
:

🧭 Onboarding GlobalKey Management (Option 1)
Context:
The onboarding tour system highlights specific UI elements across multiple screens using GlobalKeys. We initially considered passing these keys optionally (Option 2), but this introduced fragility and inconsistent developer expectations.

Final Decision (Option 1):
All screens that participate in the onboarding tour must explicitly receive any GlobalKeys they are responsible for. This ensures:

💪 Robustness — keys are never null or stale

🔄 Consistency — devs always know where keys are coming from

🔧 Future readiness — as Phase 2 expands onboarding across screens, this pattern scales cleanly

Example:
In LandingScreen, harborKey is required and passed into MainScaffold, which then uses it in the BottomNavigationBar to tag the "Harbor" icon.

Developer Guidance:

Add any onboarding GlobalKey as a required constructor parameter.

Pass it explicitly down to any widgets that need it.

Avoid default GlobalKey() instantiation inside a widget — it creates isolation and breaks onboarding tracking.

Why not Option 2? While easier for one screen, Option 2 caused:

Hidden null errors in fallback screens

Inconsistent architecture across screens

Fragile tour step logic that’s harder to debug or expand







update April 12 1947
✅ 1. Updated Narrative: GlobalKey Onboarding Pattern (Option 1 with Nuances)
Context
The onboarding system uses GlobalKeys to spotlight elements across the UI. These keys allow the tutorial to programmatically locate widgets and animate focus or tooltips around them. Initially, we explored optional keys (Option 2), but after real-world stress-testing, this approach introduced subtle architectural risks.

Final Decision: ✅ Option 1 (Required Keys Passed Explicitly)
All onboarding-relevant GlobalKeys must be passed explicitly down the widget tree.

Why We Chose Option 1:
Benefit	Description
💪 Robustness	Ensures keys are never null, avoids missing/duplicate widget tracking.
🔄 Consistency	Every screen follows the same pattern—no guessing or conditional logic.
🧱 Future-ready	Phase 2 of onboarding (multi-screen support) builds naturally from this.
🧠 Developer Clarity	Keeps ownership of GlobalKeys at the top level, avoiding in-widget instantiation.
Important Nuance
Although MainScaffold is instantiated inside appRouter, it still receives harborKey from its parent screen—LandingScreen—which was created with that harborKey. This hop is safe and deliberate:

appRouter passes the key to LandingScreen

LandingScreen passes it to MainScaffold

MainScaffold applies it to the BottomNavigationBarItem

This forward-passing maintains central control while respecting the decoupled architecture.
