I'd like a full and complete progress report: 
What initiated the refactor (getting a tour of the app to work)
What that led to (adding global keys?)
What problem that causes (backbutton issues?)
What we determined was the issue (needed .push/.go in transitionManager?)
Options that we made (to use replace: bool in all transition managers?)

That's my rough recollection, I'm sure there is a lot more. I need a way to understand where we are and how we got here and what is left to do all while understanding why a certain bug may be present and how to approach debugging it. Please supply a thorough explanation with details, filenames, methods, key, etc.






ChatGPT said:
Absolutely. Here‚Äôs a thorough and structured progress report tracing the origin, evolution, and resolution of the replace: bool refactor and its broader purpose in BCC5. This document is structured so you can debug future issues with full context of why everything is the way it is.

üî∞ ORIGIN: Onboarding Tour Triggers
‚úÖ Goal:
You wanted to implement a step-by-step onboarding tour (e.g., CoachMarks) in BCC5 that:

highlights AppBar icons (MOB, Search, Settings, Title)

works across screens

doesn't duplicate or lose widget references

üõ†Ô∏è Initial Change:
We added explicit GlobalKeys for:

mobKey, searchKey, settingsKey, titleKey

üìÅ Files impacted:
All screens using CustomAppBarWidget

LandingScreen, MainScaffold, and others now pass down keys via constructor (your chosen Option 1: prop drilling).

üîÑ STAGE 2: Tour Breakage Due to Reused GlobalKeys
‚ùå Problem Discovered:
Using the same GlobalKeys across screens triggered this error:

Multiple widgets used the same GlobalKey.

‚úÖ Solution:
Generate fresh GlobalKeys per navigation event in context.push(...), using:

dart
Copy
Edit
GlobalKey(debugLabel: 'MOBKey')
üìÅ Applied in:

ToolItemScreen, LessonItemScreen, PartItemScreen, FlashcardItemScreen

All DetailScreens

‚õî NEW PROBLEM: Broken Back Button
üß≠ Navigation Bug:
You noticed that tapping back from DetailScreen ‚Üí ItemScreen (e.g., ToolDetail ‚Üí ToolItem) sometimes returned to LandingScreen or skipped screens entirely.

üß™ Diagnosis:
The issue was traced to how navigation transitions were being triggered.

context.go(...) was used internally inside TransitionManager.goToDetailScreen(...)

context.go() replaces the navigation stack

So when detail screens were loaded using context.go, the ItemScreen (e.g. /tools/items) was removed

Thus, back navigation had nothing to return to

üß† Root Cause Confirmed:
dart
Copy
Edit
// transition_manager.dart
context.go(...)  // ‚ùå replaces stack ‚Üí back breaks
We realized we needed to retain the stack (i.e., push instead of replace) when appropriate.

üß∞ SOLUTION: Add replace: bool Parameter
‚úÖ What We Did:
Updated TransitionManager.goToDetailScreen() to include:

dart
Copy
Edit
bool replace = false
And then routed conditionally:

dart
Copy
Edit
if (replace) {
  context.go(route, extra: ...); // üîÅ Replaces stack
} else {
  context.push(route, extra: ...); // ‚ûï Adds to stack
}
‚úÖ Where We Applied It (Chronological Refactor Audit)
1. transition_manager.dart
Added replace: bool

Centralized route launching

Added transitionKey, keys, direction, etc.

2. tool_bag_screen.dart
Launches ToolItemScreen via context.push(...)

Replaced with goToDetailScreen(..., replace: false)

3. tool_detail_screen.dart
GroupPickerDropdown & "Next Chapter" buttons

Updated to use replace: true when switching categories (full replacement)

But used replace: false for in-group next/prev transitions

4. tool_item_screen.dart
Bug: Was using context.push(...)

Fixed: Replaced with goToDetailScreen(..., replace: false)

Resolved backstack skipping ToolItemScreen

5. lesson_detail_screen.dart
Same treatment: Group picker uses replace: true

In-group nav and "Next Chapter" use replace: true to fully switch module context

6. part_detail_screen.dart
Mirrored LessonDetailScreen behavior

Group switch and chapter advancement: replace: true

7. flashcard_detail_screen.dart
Group picker and next category also use replace: true

Preserves behavior of viewing drills sequentially and backstack accuracy

8. lesson_item_screen.dart, part_item_screen.dart
All direct context.push() replaced with goToDetailScreen(..., replace: false)

Fixes back behavior and makes transitions consistent

‚úÖ Final Outcome

Screen Type	To Detail (Tap)	Detail ‚Üí Next Group	Detail ‚Üí Next Item	Group Picker
ToolItemScreen	replace: false	replace: true	replace: false	replace: true
PartItemScreen	replace: false	replace: true	replace: false	replace: true
LessonItemScreen	replace: false	replace: true	replace: false	replace: true
FlashcardItemScreen	replace: false	replace: true	replace: false	replace: true
üß≠ How to Debug Future Back Button or Stack Issues
Check if TransitionManager is being used.
If not, you're bypassing stack logic.

Check the replace: value.

replace: false for stackable nav

replace: true for group/module/chapter switches

Check transitionKey + slideFrom. Helps avoid animation bugs or mismatched screen keys.

Validate GlobalKeys per screen.

Should be regenerated for each navigation

Don‚Äôt reuse a static key across screens

Watch for context.go(...) outside TransitionManager. That will likely cause stack problems.

üß© Remaining / Related Follow-ups
‚úÖ All files needing replace: logic are now updated

‚è≥ Remaining optional enhancements:

Add replace logic to path-based navigation if desired

Consider audit of backExtra redundancy (mobKey etc. passed both in root and backExtra)

Let me know if you'd like a printable version, a graph of transitions, or a new task phase (e.g., polish, path logic, or onboarding tour itself).

Thank you. I now want to zoom out from the replace: bool effort into the larger effort that began with adding the tour to the app for onboarding. Please write a thorough report that begins with the decision to implement a tour. The report should include which tour we chose and why, how we began implementing it, what problems we encountered along the way, what decisions were made when required, what efforts we undertook (including side excursions such as the replace: bool), where we are now in implementing the tour, and optional/suggested future efforts to DRY out and/or improve the code base for best practices. 

Please use the code base that is uploaded with this chat and ignore prior files since they are stale now after so much refactoring. At the beginning of your report, restate an organized version of my request.

### ‚úÖ Summary Request (Organized by User)
You asked for a **thorough and structured report** that begins with:

> the decision to implement a tour for onboarding, and includes:
- Which tour package was chosen and why
- How the implementation began
- What problems were encountered
- What decisions were made in response
- What efforts or side quests (like `replace: bool`) were triggered
- Where we are now
- Optional/suggested future efforts to DRY up or improve the codebase
- All grounded in the current uploaded codebase (not prior versions)

## üß≠ Full Report: Onboarding Tour Initiative in BCC5

### 1. üéØ INITIATION: Decision to Implement a Tour
You chose to implement an **onboarding tour** to help new users understand the UI, especially core navigational features like the MOB button, search icon, and bottom nav. The goal was to **walk users through** interactive elements in a visually guided, friendly way.

You selected the [`tutorial_coach_mark`](https://pub.dev/packages/tutorial_coach_mark) Flutter package because:
- It supports GlobalKeys to highlight specific widgets.
- It allows overlay text and user-friendly step sequencing.
- It works well without needing deep refactors of existing UI.

---

### 2. üîß IMPLEMENTATION PHASE 1: Passing GlobalKeys Cleanly

To wire the tour, we needed **GlobalKeys** for:
- `mobKey`: MOB button
- `searchKey`: search icon
- `settingsKey`: settings icon
- `titleKey`: AppBar title
- `harborKey`: bottom nav Harbor tab

#### üîç Design Decision: **Prop drilling over GlobalState**
Rather than making keys global or using a service locator, we chose:
- **Option 1**: explicitly pass GlobalKeys from top-level screens (e.g. `LandingScreen`) to lower components like `CustomAppBarWidget`.

This kept everything type-safe, trackable, and local to each widget hierarchy.

---

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è PHASE 2: Encountering Navigation + Key Conflicts

As soon as GlobalKeys were reused across screens:
- Flutter began throwing the dreaded **‚ÄúMultiple widgets used the same GlobalKey‚Äù** error.
- This was subtle: no red screen, but icons silently disappeared (especially in AppBars).
- It caused bugs like:
  - Missing AppBar icons
  - Broken navigation when returning from detail screens
  - Tour steps failing to highlight targets

#### üß† Debug Insight:
The problem arose because we passed the **same GlobalKeys** into **multiple screens simultaneously**, which is not allowed.

---

### 4. üí° SOLUTION: Generate New Keys per Screen Instance

We then pivoted to generating new `GlobalKey(...)` instances **during each navigation call**, like:

```dart
mobKey: GlobalKey(debugLabel: 'MOBKey'),
```

These keys were passed in via `.push()` or `.go()` using GoRouter extras.

This fixed:
- Icon visibility
- Tour step targeting
- Widget rebuild consistency

---

### 5. ‚öîÔ∏è SIDE QUEST: `replace: bool` in TransitionManager

While cleaning up navigation bugs, we noticed an issue with `GoRouter` transitions:
- In some cases, navigation **skipped intermediate screens** when back was pressed.
- This was especially evident in the **MOB emergency modal flow** and detail-to-item transitions.

#### üîÅ We introduced a new optional param:
```dart
replace: bool = true
```

- `replace: true` ‚Üí use `.go()` (replaces history)
- `replace: false` ‚Üí use `.push()` (preserves stack)

We updated `TransitionManager.goToDetailScreen(...)` to support this option.

‚úÖ This allowed us to preserve app stack *when needed* while keeping clean transitions elsewhere.

---

### 6. üìÅ FILES MODIFIED FOR `replace: bool` SUPPORT
All detail screens now use `replace: true` or `false` depending on context. Screens updated include:

- `tool_detail_screen.dart`
- `lesson_detail_screen.dart`
- `part_detail_screen.dart`
- `flashcard_detail_screen.dart`
- `tool_item_screen.dart`
- `lesson_item_screen.dart`
- `part_item_screen.dart`

With changes to their `TransitionManager.goToDetailScreen(...)` calls.

---

### 7. üìç CURRENT STATUS

- ‚úÖ All *DetailScreens* and *ItemScreens* use the new `replace:` parameter.
- ‚úÖ All GlobalKey conflicts resolved by generating fresh keys per screen.
- ‚úÖ Tour logic now safely supports highlighting multiple widgets across screens.
- ‚úÖ Transition behaviors (stack vs replacement) are now explicit.
- ‚úÖ Tour GlobalKeys are passed from `LandingScreen` and respected downstream.

---

### 8. üßº RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS & DRY Suggestions

#### ‚úÖ Short-term:
- **Refactor `LandingScreen` ‚Üí `_TourKeys` wrapper** to avoid repeating GlobalKey boilerplate.
- Create a utility:
  ```dart
  Map<String, GlobalKey> generateTourKeys() => {
    'mobKey': GlobalKey(debugLabel: 'MOBKey'),
    ...
  };
  ```

#### üßº Long-term Improvements:
- **Abstract common `.push()`/.go()` logic** into `TransitionManager` for consistency:
  ```dart
  TransitionManager.navigate({
    required String route,
    required Map<String, dynamic> extra,
    required bool replace,
  });
  ```

- **Create a reusable `AppKeys` manager** that lives near `main()` and is passed into widget trees.

- **Add key null checks** or `asserts` to prevent silent breaks in future refactors.

Let me know if you'd like a **visual dependency graph**, a **transition debugging checklist**, or a **DRY refactor plan** for the key-passing strategy.
















Awesome ‚Äî here are **all three deliverables**, designed to help you confidently navigate, debug, and refactor the onboarding + transition system in BCC5.

---

## üîó 1. Visual Dependency Graph for Onboarding Tour & Key Usage

```
LandingScreen
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generates fresh GlobalKeys:
‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mobKey
‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settingsKey
‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ searchKey
‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ titleKey
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ passes keys to ‚Üí
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CustomAppBarWidget (via props)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BottomNavigationBar (e.g. harborKey)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Navigates via GoRouter to ‚Üí
‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *ItemScreens (LessonItemScreen, PartItemScreen, etc.)
‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *DetailScreens (LessonDetailScreen, PartDetailScreen, etc.)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Each destination screen receives its own:
‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ renderItems
‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ currentIndex
‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backDestination + backExtra
‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ detailRoute
‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NEW GLOBALKEYS:
‚îÇ           ‚û§ mobKey: GlobalKey(debugLabel: 'MOBKey')
‚îÇ           ‚û§ settingsKey: ...
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ These keys are then passed into:
      CustomAppBarWidget
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Key Insight:** every screen must receive **fresh** GlobalKeys to avoid widget duplication errors in Flutter.

## üß≠ 2. Transition Debugging Checklist (Stack vs Replacement)

Use this checklist when transitions or back navigation feels broken:

| ‚úÖ Check | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Is `TransitionManager.goToDetailScreen()` called? | Confirms transition is centralized |
| Is `replace: true` or `false` passed in? | `.go()` clears history, `.push()` stacks |
| Is the **correct screenType** passed? | Mismatches will load the wrong detail route |
| Are **GlobalKeys** fresh for this transition? | Reusing keys causes silent UI breaks |
| Does the target route use `CustomTransitionPage`? | Needed for animation to work |
| Is `transitionKey` unique? | Flutter uses this to identify transitions |
| Is `slideFrom` direction correct? | e.g. right when drilling down, left when returning |
| Are keys being accessed safely from `.extra`? | All should use fallback-safe casting |

---

## üßº 3. DRY Refactor Plan for Key-Passing Strategy

### ‚úÖ GOAL: Eliminate key boilerplate and ensure consistency

---

### üîπ Step 1: Create a `TourKeys` data class
```dart
class TourKeys {
  final GlobalKey mobKey;
  final GlobalKey settingsKey;
  final GlobalKey searchKey;
  final GlobalKey titleKey;

  TourKeys({
    required this.mobKey,
    required this.settingsKey,
    required this.searchKey,
    required this.titleKey,
  });

  factory TourKeys.generateFresh() => TourKeys(
        mobKey: GlobalKey(debugLabel: 'MOBKey'),
        settingsKey: GlobalKey(debugLabel: 'SettingsKey'),
        searchKey: GlobalKey(debugLabel: 'SearchKey'),
        titleKey: GlobalKey(debugLabel: 'TitleKey'),
      );
}
```

---

### üîπ Step 2: Use `TourKeys` in `LandingScreen`
```dart
final tourKeys = TourKeys.generateFresh();

ToolItemScreen(
  toolbag: 'emergencies',
  mobKey: tourKeys.mobKey,
  settingsKey: tourKeys.settingsKey,
  searchKey: tourKeys.searchKey,
  titleKey: tourKeys.titleKey,
);
```

---

### üîπ Step 3: Update `TransitionManager` to accept `TourKeys`
Instead of passing 4 separate keys:
```dart
TransitionManager.goToDetailScreen(
  ...
  tourKeys: TourKeys.generateFresh(),
);
```

Then internally:
```dart
extra: {
  ...
  'mobKey': tourKeys.mobKey,
  'settingsKey': tourKeys.settingsKey,
  ...
}
```

This avoids copy-pasting the same 4 keys everywhere.

---

### üîπ Step 4: Update all screens to accept `TourKeys`
```dart
final TourKeys tourKeys;

CustomAppBarWidget(
  mobKey: tourKeys.mobKey,
  ...
);
```

---

### üîπ Step 5: Optional
Make `TourKeys?` nullable on screens like `ToolItemScreen`, and fallback to dummy keys in testing/dev scenarios.

---

### üß© Bonus: Use `AppKeys` for non-tour GlobalKeys
If future features need GlobalKeys unrelated to onboarding (e.g. FABs, drawers, bottom nav), create a separate `AppKeys` class to manage those.

---

Let me know if you want me to generate:
- The refactored `TourKeys` class and how it plugs into `TransitionManager`
- A visual tour step configuration for `tutorial_coach_mark`
- Or a sample unit test to verify key uniqueness per screen instance.













































Awesome! Here‚Äôs the full spell-out for each of the three advanced tour features you requested. These will make onboarding robust, contextual, and expandable.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. `TourManager` Class ‚Äî Saves and Checks ‚ÄúTour Completed‚Äù Status

---

### üìÅ File: `lib/utils/tour_manager.dart`

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

class TourManager {
  static const String _mainTourKey = 'tour_completed_main';
  static const String _detailTourKey = 'tour_completed_detail';

  /// Mark main tour (on LandingScreen) as completed
  static Future<void> markMainTourCompleted() async {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    await prefs.setBool(_mainTourKey, true);
  }

  /// Check if main tour was completed
  static Future<bool> isMainTourCompleted() async {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    return prefs.getBool(_mainTourKey) ?? false;
  }

  /// Mark detail tour (e.g., FlipCard, GroupPicker) as completed
  static Future<void> markDetailTourCompleted() async {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    await prefs.setBool(_detailTourKey, true);
  }

  /// Check if detail tour was completed
  static Future<bool> isDetailTourCompleted() async {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    return prefs.getBool(_detailTourKey) ?? false;
  }

  /// Clear tour state (useful for dev or settings reset)
  static Future<void> resetAllTours() async {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    await prefs.remove(_mainTourKey);
    await prefs.remove(_detailTourKey);
  }
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Conditional Launch of the Tour (First-Time Only)

---

### üîÅ In `LandingScreen` (or wherever your main tour begins):

```dart
final tourKeys = TourKeys.generateFresh();

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) async {
    final alreadyCompleted = await TourManager.isMainTourCompleted();
    if (!alreadyCompleted) {
      OnboardingTour.startTour(
        context: context,
        tourKeys: tourKeys,
        onFinish: () => TourManager.markMainTourCompleted(),
      );
    }
  });
}
```

### üõ† Update your `OnboardingTour.startTour(...)` to support the callback:

```dart
static void startTour({
  required BuildContext context,
  required TourKeys tourKeys,
  VoidCallback? onFinish,
}) {
  final steps = [ /* same steps as before */ ];

  TutorialCoachMark(
    context,
    targets: steps,
    colorShadow: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.8),
    textSkip: "Skip",
    onFinish: () {
      logger.i("üéâ Tour completed");
      if (onFinish != null) onFinish();
    },
  ).show();
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ 3. ‚ÄúPart 2‚Äù Detail Screen Tour ‚Äî Flashcard Flip, GroupPicker, MOB

---

### üéØ Recommended Tour Steps (pick and choose per screen):

| Step        | Key Target             | Label                        | Purpose                                           |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `flipCard`  | `GlobalKey()`          | ‚ÄúTap to Flip‚Äù                | Introduces flashcard flipping interaction         |
| `groupPicker` | `GlobalKey()`        | ‚ÄúSwitch Category / Module‚Äù   | Introduces GroupPickerDropdown                   |
| `mobModal`  | `GlobalKey()`          | ‚ÄúMOB Tools‚Äù                  | Highlights MOB emergency button/modal             |

You can wire this in `FlashcardDetailScreen`, `LessonDetailScreen`, etc., like so:

---

### üìÅ `FlashcardDetailScreen` (add to `initState`):

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  // Flashcard init...
  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) async {
    final shown = await TourManager.isDetailTourCompleted();
    if (!shown) {
      _startFlashcardDetailTour();
      await TourManager.markDetailTourCompleted();
    }
  });
}
```

---

### üîÑ `_startFlashcardDetailTour()` method:

```dart
void _startFlashcardDetailTour() {
  final flipKey = GlobalKey();
  final groupPickerKey = GlobalKey();

  final steps = [
    TargetFocus(
      identify: "flip",
      keyTarget: flipKey,
      contents: [
        TargetContent(
          align: ContentAlign.bottom,
          builder: (_) => const Text("Tap here to flip the card"),
        ),
      ],
    ),
    TargetFocus(
      identify: "group",
      keyTarget: groupPickerKey,
      contents: [
        TargetContent(
          align: ContentAlign.bottom,
          builder: (_) => const Text("Pick a different flashcard category"),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ];

  TutorialCoachMark(
    context,
    targets: steps,
    colorShadow: Colors.deepPurple,
    textSkip: "Skip",
    onFinish: () => logger.i("Flashcard detail tour done"),
  ).show();
}
```

üí° To support this visually, you‚Äôll need to wrap your widgets with `KeyedSubtree(key: ...)` or directly use `key: groupPickerKey` where you declare them in the widget tree.

---

## üßº Bonus: DRY Tour Integration Plan (Optional)

Once this logic is finalized, consider creating a `TourInjector` class or `TourController` that can be passed to any screen to:

- Load the correct `TourKeys`
- Run `.startIfFirstTime()`
- Allow "restart tour" manually via a settings toggle

This keeps the logic centralized and avoids reimplementing `SharedPreferences` checks in every screen.

---

Let me know if you'd like this bonus `TourController` scaffold.






Perfect ‚Äî here's a **reusable `TourController` scaffold** to DRY up tour logic across your app:

---

## ‚úÖ Purpose

- üß† Centralize logic for checking and running tours
- üîÅ Works for both main (Landing) and detail (Flashcard, Lesson, etc.) tours
- ‚öôÔ∏è Supports first-time auto-run, manual re-run, and debug reset

---

## üìÅ `lib/utils/tour_controller.dart`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:bcc5/utils/tour_manager.dart';
import 'package:bcc5/widgets/onboarding_tour.dart'; // Adjust if renamed
import 'package:bcc5/widgets/tour_keys.dart'; // Your TourKeys class

enum TourType {
  main,
  detail,
}

class TourController {
  final TourType type;
  final TourKeys tourKeys;

  TourController({
    required this.type,
    required this.tourKeys,
  });

  /// Automatically runs the tour if it hasn't been completed yet.
  Future<void> startIfFirstTime(BuildContext context) async {
    final completed = await _getCompletionStatus();
    if (!completed) {
      _start(context);
    }
  }

  /// Manually force the tour (e.g., from settings or debug tools)
  void start(BuildContext context) {
    _start(context);
  }

  /// Resets the completion flag for this tour type
  Future<void> reset() async {
    if (type == TourType.main) {
      await TourManager.resetMainTour();
    } else {
      await TourManager.resetDetailTour();
    }
  }

  Future<bool> _getCompletionStatus() async {
    return type == TourType.main
        ? await TourManager.isMainTourCompleted()
        : await TourManager.isDetailTourCompleted();
  }

  Future<void> _markCompleted() async {
    if (type == TourType.main) {
      await TourManager.markMainTourCompleted();
    } else {
      await TourManager.markDetailTourCompleted();
    }
  }

  void _start(BuildContext context) {
    OnboardingTour.startTour(
      context: context,
      tourKeys: tourKeys,
      onFinish: () {
        _markCompleted();
      },
    );
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ Usage Example (e.g. `LandingScreen`)

```dart
late final TourController _tourController;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  final keys = TourKeys.generateFresh();
  _tourController = TourController(
    type: TourType.main,
    tourKeys: keys,
  );

  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
    _tourController.startIfFirstTime(context);
  });
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Usage Example (e.g. `FlashcardDetailScreen`, `LessonDetailScreen`)

```dart
late final TourController _tourController;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _tourController = TourController(
    type: TourType.detail,
    tourKeys: TourKeys.generateFresh(), // Or pass existing ones
  );

  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
    _tourController.startIfFirstTime(context);
  });
}
```

---

## üß™ Bonus: Debug Reset Button (Settings screen idea)

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    TourController(type: TourType.main, tourKeys: TourKeys.generateDummy()).reset();
    TourController(type: TourType.detail, tourKeys: TourKeys.generateDummy()).reset();
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(const SnackBar(
      content: Text("Tour state reset."),
    ));
  },
  child: const Text('Reset All Tours'),
)
```

## üîÆ Optional Enhancements

- Add `TourType.flashcard`, `TourType.lesson`, etc. for fine-grained control
- Log tour launches with `logger.i(...)`
- Store timestamp of last tour run for future analytics
- Combine with your `DevSettingsModal` or onboarding status in app state

Let me know if you'd like the `TourKeys.generateDummy()` fallback method too, or a hook to launch a specific tour section (like just MOB or just Flip)!
