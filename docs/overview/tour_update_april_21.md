Great summary and solid instincts throughout this. Let’s tackle your two key questions carefully:

---

### ✅ 1. Can the **onboarding tour** still work with this approach?

**Yes, it absolutely can — but with one change in how the tour framework is fed the GlobalKeys.**

#### The original design:
Tour relied on upstream-provided `GlobalKey`s passed through `.extra` so it could consistently locate widgets like `mobKey`, `settingsKey`, etc., even across transitions.

#### The new approach:
Now that each screen (and `CustomAppBarWidget`) generates its own keys internally, the tour framework won’t be able to access those keys **unless you expose them** after widget creation.

#### Solution:
Expose the keys from the rendered `CustomAppBarWidget` after instantiation. For example:

```dart
final appBar = CustomAppBarWidget(title: 'Courses', ...);

// Then pass keys to the tour controller
TourManager.registerStep('mob', appBar.mobKey);
TourManager.registerStep('search', appBar.searchKey);
...
```

You can do this within the screen’s `build()` method or in a post-frame callback if needed. As long as the tour can get access to the `GlobalKey` references **after widget creation**, everything will work.

> ✅ So: You do **not** need to revert the GlobalKey internalization, just ensure they're still exposed to the tour logic.

### 🧠 2. Will MOB modal return flow still work?

You nailed the intention:
- Tapping the MOB icon opens a **modal**.
- Inside the modal, the “Other Emergencies” button navigates to `ToolItemScreen(procedures)`.
- When that screen is popped (e.g. via the back button), the MOB modal should **still be active**.
- Finally, closing the MOB modal should return the user to the screen they were originally on (e.g. `LessonItemScreen`, `PathItemScreen`, etc.).

#### This works today because:
- `showMOBModal(context)` uses `showDialog(...)`, which overlays the modal without popping the base route.
- Navigating inside the modal (e.g., `context.push(...)` to `/tools/items`) doesn’t affect the original route stack.
- Popping from `/tools/items` returns to the MOB modal.
- Closing the modal (via the X or backdrop) reveals the original screen underneath.

#### Danger Zone:
If we ever replace `showDialog(...)` with a push route or `Navigator.of(context).push(...)`, this logic breaks — we’d need to manually track:

- The route the user was on before MOB modal opened.
- Whether they navigated within the modal.
- A smart “restore” on modal close.

> ✅ As it stands: this is solid. No change needed — but we should **document this dependency** in the codebase for future devs.

### 🧩 Next Steps

You're cleared to move on to:
> `lessonDetailScreen(branch)` for full audit + refactor.

Let me know when you're ready and I’ll walk you through a clean audit and key simplification plan (likely much shorter than LessonItemScreen was).
