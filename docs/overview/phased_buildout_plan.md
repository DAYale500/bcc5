Absolutely ‚Äî starting with a **layered, complexity-aware plan** is one of the smartest things you can do. Since you're building something modular and content-heavy like the BCC4 sailing app, it‚Äôs important to **balance speed, scalability, and maintainability**.

Here‚Äôs a recommended **5-phase buildout plan**, grounded in best practices for Flutter app development and tailored to your project:

---

## üöß **Phase 1: Foundation & Skeleton (Minimum Viable Navigation)**

**Goal:** Establish consistent UI structure, routing, and navigation without complex content or data models.

### ‚úÖ Tasks
1. **Set up `MainScaffold`** with bottom navigation bar.
2. Implement **placeholder top-level screens**:
   - `ModulesScreen`, `PartsScreen`, `FlashcardsScreen`, `LearningPathsScreen`
3. Build reusable **`FilterButton` and `DetailButton` widgets** with sample text.
4. Set up **centralized navigation** with `app_router.dart`:
   - Forward (right), backward (left), scale, no animation options.
5. Implement **CustomAppBarWidget** with back button support.

**Best Practices:**
- Use dummy models and stub data early on.
- Finalize all navigation transitions **now** to avoid breaking animations later.

## üî∑ **Phase 2: Real Data Models & Repositories**

**Goal:** Replace stubs with structured models and real data files for each branch.

### ‚úÖ Tasks
1. Implement `ModuleModel`, `LessonModel`, `BoatPartModel`, `FlashcardModel`, `PathModel`, etc.
2. Build modular repositories:
   - `module_repository.dart`, `part_repository.dart`, etc.
3. Update top-level screens to use **actual filter/detail logic**.
4. Add **logger statements** for debugging taps and filters.

**Best Practices:**
- Keep each model in its own file (`*_model.dart`).
- Group data logically: lessons under modules, parts under zones, etc.

---

## üå± **Phase 3: Detail Screens & Structured Content**

**Goal:** Begin adding real educational content with structured formatting and navigation support.

### ‚úÖ Tasks
1. Build `LessonDetailScreen` with:
   - Interleaved text/image content from `content` field
   - Smooth scrolling
2. Build `PartDetailScreen` using the same model.
3. Add `FlashcardViewerScreen` and `PathItemScreen` with stub content initially.
4. Use placeholder content for parts with no images or lesson text.

**Best Practices:**
- Use a `ContentBlock` widget to render structured content.
- Make all detail screens scrollable and test on both phone/tablet sizes.

---

## üîÅ **Phase 4: Navigation Intelligence + Flashcard Integration**

**Goal:** Improve navigation flow and link related resources together.

### ‚úÖ Tasks
1. Enable back stack memory (e.g., Part ‚ûù Lesson ‚ûù Back ‚ûù Returns to Part).
2. Add Previous/Next navigation in LessonDetail and PathItem screens.
3. Add Flashcards below LessonDetail or link via button.
4. Handle `backDestination` and `backExtra` routing cleanly across all branches.

**Best Practices:**
- Use `PopScope` and `context.go(...)` for clean back transitions.
- Ensure every screen knows its origin ‚Äî especially for sequences or keyword jumps.

---

## üöÄ **Phase 5: Smart Features, Polishing & Expansion**

**Goal:** Add final polish, free/paid gating, NMEA 2000 hooks, and advanced user tools.

### ‚úÖ Tasks
1. Add paid content toggling and Settings enhancements.
2. Add flashcard randomizer.
3. Hook up actual NMEA 2000 data stream if desired.
4. Expand Learning Paths with mixed item types.
5. Build onboarding tour or tutorial.

**Best Practices:**
- Avoid hardcoded logic; always build for future scalability.
- Document all transition helpers, screen contracts, and route parameters.
