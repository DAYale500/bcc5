## üß± BCC5 Coding Rules & Architecture Conventions

### ‚úÖ Enforced Rules

#### Architecture & Layout
- **All screens must use `MainScaffold`** unless explicitly designed otherwise (e.g. modals).
- **`CustomAppBarWidget` must be used per screen**, not injected globally.
- `MainScaffold` must wrap only the core screen (no nested MainScaffolds).
- All screens must pass **explicit `branchIndex`** to `MainScaffold`.
- Use **reusable UI components** like `GroupButton`, `ItemButton` ‚Äî not branch-specific variants.

#### UI & Theming
- **All styles (color, typography, layout) must come from `AppTheme`.**
- Centralized theme includes AppBar, BNB, button radius/padding, typography, etc.
- `CustomAppBarWidget` must reference AppTheme only.
- Hex `#163FE8` is the official `primaryBlue`.

#### Navigation
- **Use `GoRouter` (`context.push` / `context.go`)** for all navigation.
- Use `PopScope` instead of deprecated `WillPopScope`.
- Always pass `backDestination`, `backExtra` for consistency.
- Centralized `NavigationContext` helpers define transitions.

#### Logic & Models
- **Parse all IDs via `id_parser.dart`** (e.g., to get module/zone/type).
- Do not duplicate fields (e.g., no `.module` if derivable from `lesson.id`).
- Repositories must validate IDs with assert (e.g., prefix check).

#### Repositories & Structure
- Models: `lesson_model.dart`, `part_model.dart`, etc.
- Repos: `lesson_docking_repository.dart`, `part_rigging_repository.dart`, etc.
- Index files: `lesson_repository_index.dart`, etc.
- Each index must provide:
  - `.getItemsForGroup(...)`
  - `.getItemById(...)`
  - `.getGroupNames()`

#### Dev & Debug
- **Use `logger.i(...)`** for screen entry, user actions, and debug flow.
- Logger tags must be emoji-coded by screen: üü¶, üü•, üü©, etc.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Proposed Rules / Pending Enforcement

- `MainScaffold` should also enforce route guarding / redirect logic centrally.
- Add dark mode toggle in Settings screen.
- Repository validation should be run as part of CI/linter.
- Enforce absence of hardcoded colors/styles in linter.

# BCC5 Coding Rules & Architecture Conventions

## 1. Navigation

1.1 All screen-to-screen transitions must go through `GoRouter` and respect `app_router.dart` transition definitions.  
1.2 Back navigation must use `PopScope` + `context.go(...)` to ensure left-slide animations and back stack consistency.  
1.3 `CustomAppBarWidget` must be added per-screen, not through `MainScaffold`, to preserve back button logic.

## 2. Screen Architecture

2.1 All primary screens must be wrapped in `MainScaffold`.  
2.2 BottomNavigationBar index must be passed as `branchIndex`, not `selectedIndex`.  
2.3 All screens must include a custom `AppBar` using `CustomAppBarWidget`.  
2.4 Screens must support optional `showBackButton`, `showSettingsIcon`, and `showSearchIcon` flags.

## 3. Theming

3.1 All color and style values must be defined in `AppTheme`. No inline styling is allowed.  
3.2 Light and dark themes must be supported.  
3.3 AppBar and BottomNavigationBar must derive their styles from `AppTheme.lightTheme` and `AppTheme.darkTheme`.

## 4. Model Structure

4.1 No duplication of fields (e.g., `.module` should not appear if it can be parsed from `.id`).  
4.2 Use a shared utility (`id_parser.dart`) to extract type/group/sequence from any content ID.  
4.3 All models must be suffixed with `_model.dart`.

## 5. Repository Indexing

5.1 Each content category (lessons, parts, tools, etc.) must have an index file that lists available groups and items.  
5.2 Each index file must implement an `assertIdsMatchRepositoryPrefix()` method.  
5.3 Group identifiers (e.g., 'docking', 'hull') must be consistent with repository map keys.

## 6. Logging

6.1 Use `logger.i(...)` for all major navigation actions.  
6.2 Avoid `print` statements or unused loggers.  
6.3 Ensure logs include emojis or keywords for easy grep-based analysis.

## 7. File Structure

7.1 All files must follow the `lib/screens`, `lib/data/models`, `lib/data/repositories`, `lib/utils`, and `lib/widgets` structure.  
7.2 No top-level Dart files outside the approved directories.  
7.3 Match screen names to file names (e.g., `LessonItemScreen` in `lesson_item_screen.dart`).

## 8. Shared Widgets

8.1 Reusable UI components like buttons must be defined in `widgets/`.  
8.2 Avoid screen-specific widget definitions inline.  
8.3 Use `GroupButton` and `ItemButton` consistently.

## 9. Testing/Validation Rules

9.1 Each screen must be tested for: back button behavior, AppBar visibility, BottomNav index accuracy.  
9.2 Manual testing must include launching from home and from a deep link.

## 10. Naming Conventions

10.1 Use camelCase for variables and methods, PascalCase for classes.  
10.2 Navigation keys like `branchIndex`, `backDestination`, and `sequenceList` must be used consistently.

## 11. In-Progress Rules or Fixes (Tracked)

11.1 ‚ö†Ô∏è `CustomAppBarWidget` still missing from some screens.  
11.2 ‚ö†Ô∏è `MainScaffold` improperly duplicated in a few routes.  
11.3 ‚ö†Ô∏è `branchIndex` inconsistently used ‚Äî some `selectedIndex` still remain.

üìò Pattern Reminder for All Screens
All GoRouter routes wrap the screen in MainScaffold.
All screen files define only:
AppBar (via CustomAppBarWidget)
Body (Column, ListView, GridView, etc.)
Optional PopScope if needed
This is now the official BCC5 screen pattern.

Rule: Route Structure & MainScaffold Wrapping
All primary screens (Landing, LessonModule, PartZone, etc.) must not return full Scaffolds themselves.
Instead, each screen should return a Column containing:
A CustomAppBarWidget
An Expanded body (e.g., ListView, GridView, etc.)
These screens will be wrapped in MainScaffold by the corresponding GoRoute in app_router.dart.
MainScaffold provides the BottomNavigationBar and accepts an optional AppBar via parameter.
This approach avoids duplicate BNB rendering and keeps logic centralized, reducing risk of layout inconsistencies.



## Route + Scaffold Pattern Rule

üß† All primary content screens should follow this architecture pattern:

1. **Routing**  
   - Each screen is launched via a `GoRoute` in `app_router.dart`.
   - Dynamic data (e.g., `module`, `zone`, `category`, etc.) should be passed via `state.extra`.

2. **Screen Widget Structure**  
   - The screen widget (e.g., `LessonItemScreen`, `PartItemScreen`) should:
     - Be passed all necessary data via constructor.
     - Return a `Column` containing:
       - A `CustomAppBarWidget`
       - An `Expanded` child (typically `ListView`, `GridView`, etc.)

3. **MainScaffold Wrapping**  
   - `MainScaffold` should be applied **in the route**, not inside the screen itself.
   - This avoids double BottomNavigationBars (BNB) and ensures consistent `branchIndex` control.

‚úÖ This enforces clean separation between layout and logic, enables smarter transitions, and keeps widgets reusable/testable.




üß± Architecture Rule: AppBar and BNB Pattern
All screens should only return the AppBar + Body and be wrapped externally in MainScaffold by the route.
This ensures:

üßº Clean separation of layout and logic

üö´ No accidental double BottomNavigationBar

üß≠ Centralized control of transitions and navigation behavior

DO NOT: Nest a Scaffold inside a screen that's already wrapped in MainScaffold.
DO: Use CustomAppBarWidget inside the screen and pass it via appBar: to MainScaffold.






‚ÄúIf a widget might support custom back navigation (e.g. to maintain deep-link state), always expose an optional VoidCallback? onBack parameter.‚Äù





‚úÖ 2. Dev Guideline: AppBar Back Button Logic
Screen	Should pass onBack?	Reason
LessonItemScreen	‚úÖ Yes	Needs to go back to LessonModuleScreen via context.go()
PartItemScreen	‚úÖ Yes	Must return to PartZoneScreen
FlashcardItemScreen	‚úÖ Yes	Returns to FlashcardCategoryScreen
PathItemScreen	‚úÖ Yes	Returns to PathChapterScreen
ContentDetailScreen	‚úÖ Yes (if from items)	Ensures backDestination is respected
ContentDetailScreen (Search)	‚ùå No (uses fallback)	No reliable origin screen
HomeScreen	‚ùå No	No back button needed
üß≠ Policy:

If a screen was pushed via context.push(...) from a known origin, pass onBack explicitly using context.go(...) with the correct destination.

If origin is ambiguous (e.g. search), rely on fallback logic inside CustomAppBarWidget.

// TODO: Add `onBack` and `branchIndex` support for clean navigation.
// This ensures proper back behavior and bottom nav visibility in ContentDetailScreen.
// Refer to `LessonItemScreen` or `PartItemScreen` for the implementation pattern.








### üß≠ Rule: All Navigations to `/content` Must Include Sequencing Extras

To support `ContentScreenNavigator` and the shared `ContentDetailScreen`, all navigation to the `/content` route must include the following in `extra`:

- `sequenceTitles`: `List<String>` of item titles.
- `contentMap`: `Map<String, List<ContentBlock>>` keyed by title.
- `startIndex`: `int` ‚Äî where to begin in the sequence.
- `branchIndex`: `int` ‚Äî tab index for BottomNavigationBar.
- `backDestination`: `String` ‚Äî GoRouter path to return to.
- `backExtra`: `Map<String, dynamic>` ‚Äî extras required to rebuild previous screen.

Even if a screen only shows one item (e.g., a single part), wrap it in a one-item sequence.

#### ‚úÖ Example:
```dart
context.push('/content', extra: {
  'sequenceTitles': ['Deck Cleats'],
  'contentMap': {'Deck Cleats': cleatContent},
  'startIndex': 0,
  'branchIndex': 2,
  'backDestination': '/parts/items',
  'backExtra': {'zone': 'Deck', 'branchIndex': 2},
});










‚úÖ Got it! Here's the full rule formatted for your existing dev guide.

---

### üìò `ContentScreenNavigator` Routing Rule

#### üîê Rule: All Navigations to `/content` Must Include Full Sequencing Extras

To maintain consistent behavior across all branches (Lessons, Parts, Flashcards, Tools, Paths), the `/content` route **must always receive** a complete set of sequencing extras. These extras are used by `ContentScreenNavigator` to determine which item to show, how to navigate between them, and how to return cleanly.

---

#### ‚úÖ Required `extra` fields for `/content`:

| Key              | Type                           | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sequenceTitles` | `List<String>`                 | Ordered list of all item titles in the sequence                        |
| `contentMap`     | `Map<String, List<ContentBlock>>` | Map of title ‚Üí content blocks (same keys as in `sequenceTitles`)       |
| `startIndex`     | `int`                          | Which item to start displaying                                         |
| `branchIndex`    | `int`                          | Used to set the correct BottomNavigationBar tab                        |
| `backDestination`| `String`                       | GoRouter path to return to (e.g., `/lessons/items`)                    |
| `backExtra`      | `Map<String, dynamic>`         | All extras needed to rebuild the previous screen context               |

---

#### üîÅ Even for singleton content (e.g. single part or tool):

Wrap the item as a **single-item sequence** to maintain compatibility:

```dart
context.push('/content', extra: {
  'sequenceTitles': ['Deck Cleats'],
  'contentMap': {'Deck Cleats': cleatContent},
  'startIndex': 0,
  'branchIndex': 2,
  'backDestination': '/parts/items',
  'backExtra': {'zone': 'Deck', 'branchIndex': 2},
});
```

---

#### üí° Why this rule exists:
- Enables Previous/Next navigation across branches.
- Centralizes back button logic inside `ContentDetailScreen`.
- Keeps all content flow uniform and scalable.

## ‚úÖ New Rule for Dev Guide (Rule #12)

```md
## 12. Flashcard Architecture

12.1 All flashcards must be **embedded inside their source item** (`LessonItem`, `PartItem`, or `ToolItem`).  
12.2 Flashcards are **not stored in separate repositories**. They live within the same model and repository file as their source.  
12.3 A shared utility file (e.g., `flashcard_repository.dart`) may exist to extract and group flashcards for UX purposes only.  
12.4 All flashcards must follow the ID format: `flashcard_<sourceId>_<index>`.  
12.5 Every lesson, part, or tool must include at least one flashcard.  
12.6 Do not duplicate flashcards across models. If a concept is shared, create a shared utility flashcard object and reference it if needed.

‚úÖ This rule guarantees content cohesion and simplifies review workflows.
